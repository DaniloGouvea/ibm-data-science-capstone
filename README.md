IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Capstone Project

## About this repository
This repo contains all the notebooks and the source code for a simple Plotly Dash app that were all produced for the final project (capstone) of the IBM Data Science professional certificate.

## Plotly Dash dashboard
The dashboard was later hosted on Heroku as an extra effort (not required by the IBM course) and can be found on (https://spacex-ibm-dash.herokuapp.com/).

It is a simple web application, nonetheless it showcases how easy and flexible Dash can be for the creation and deployment of dashboards.
